# pyourney

This is my journey of brushing up on Python basics while diving into the endless possibilities the language offers.

# What’s in Here?

- Python Fundamentals: Notes, exercises, and code snippets to solidify the core concepts of Python—basically, me getting back to the roots.

- OpenCV Explorations: Started playing around with OpenCV! It’s been fun working with images and learning the basics of computer vision.

- Future Plans: This repo will keep growing as I explore more Python libraries. Planning to dig into some smaller, handy libraries like itertools, collections, functools, and os. Might also take a shot at visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, and do some cool stuff with NumPy and Pandas.

# Why This Repo?

I’m using this as a way to:

- Sharpen my Python skills.
- Document my learning process.
- Build a reference for myself as I tackle new challenges.
